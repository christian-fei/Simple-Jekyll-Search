Simple-Jekyll-Search
====================

* No additional gems required
* Works out of the box
* Even works with [Jekyll GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)!
* Fast, lightweight, super easy to set up and fully customizable with CSS!





##Setup

There's an example included in this repo, check it out to fiddle around with the plugin really quickly.
Just `jekyll serve` the page and there you go.


### Steps

1) Include the basic `search.json` in the root of your Jekyll site

2) Include the script in your page

```html
<script src="js/jekyll-search.js"></script>
```

3) Add an input field for searching and an element to render the search results in.

E.g.:

```html
<input type="text" id="search" placeholder="search this site">
<ul id="search-results"></ul>
```

4) <a href="#customize-the-plugin">Customize the plugin</a>




##Customize the plugin

If you want, you can customize several options of this plugin:

- `searchInput`				(Element) the input field to listen on
- `searchResults`			(Element) the container to which JekyllSearch will write the matched search results 
- `jsonFile`				(String) location of the JSON file, our little "database"
- `template`				(String) <a href="#template">template</a> (Mustache-like)
- `searchResultsHeader`		(String) Heading of the search results
- `limit`					(Integer) Limit the search results to a sane amount (10-15)
- `fuzzy`					(Boolean) Turn on/off <a href="#fuzzy-search">fuzzy search</a>
- `noResults`				(String) Text to display if nothing matched the search criteria

---

You can pass the customized properties into an object when you invoke the init function, like this:

Let's say I want to apply JekyllSearch to a non-default input field (`.search`), e.g. `#search-this-page`.

I also changed the location of the JSON file, which is now `site-search.json` and I have a different <a href="#template">template</a>.

Plus I want to turn on <a href="#fuzzy-search">fuzzy search</a>:


```javascript
JekyllSearch.init({
    searchInput: document.getElementById("search"),
    searchResults: document.getElementById("search-results"),
    jsonFile: "search.json",
    template: "<li><a href='{url}' title='{desc}'>{title}</a></li>",
    noResults: "no results found",
    fuzzy: true
});
```

The only thing left to do is to put the  <a href="https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search/blob/master/search.json">search.json</a> file in the root directory of your Jekyll site to generate the JSON needed by JekyllSearch.




##Template

Templates in JekyllSearch are very dependent on your `search.json` file. You can only use properties that are listed in your mini-database.

In the default `search.json` file, these fields are defined and contains relevant information about an article:

"title", "category", "url" and "data".

So you can only use these fields in the template.

---

The syntax is fairly straightforward, put curly braces around a property and it will be replaced by JekyllSearch in that exact position.

E.g.

`<a href='{url}' title='{desc}'>{title}</a>` results in the following output for the first article:

`<a href='/jekyll-search-example/' title='This is an example description'>JekyllSearch example</a>`





##Fuzzy search

Ahh, good old fuzzy search..

I try to explain it with an example:

Finds the string `lorem ipsum dolor sit amet` even if you mistype several characters, like `lorm isum dlor st amt`







##Browser support

Browser support should be about IE6+ with this `addEventListener` [shim](https://gist.github.com/eirikbacker/2864711#file-addeventlistener-polyfill-js)







##jQuery

```javascript
$(".search").jekyllSearch( options );
```
