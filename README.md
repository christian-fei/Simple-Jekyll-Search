# [Demo](http://christian-fei.github.io/Simple-Jekyll-Search/)



# Getting started

- Place the following code in a file called `search.json` in the **root** of your Jekyll blog. This file will be used as a small data source to perform the searches on the client side:

```
---
layout: null
---
[
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {
      "title"    : "{{ post.title | escape }}",
      "category" : "{{ post.category }}",
      "tags"     : "{{ post.tags | join: ', ' }}",
      "url"      : "{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}",
      "date"     : "{{ post.date }}"
    } {% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}
  {% endfor %}
]
```

- initialize the library ( [options](#options) )

### Enabling full-text search
Note that the index generated in `search.json` does not include the posts' content since you may not want to load the whole content of your blog in each single page. However, if some of you want to enable full-text search, you can still add the posts' content to the index, either to the normal search, or on an additional search page with a dedicated second index file. To do this, simply add 
```
"content"  : "{{ post.content | strip_html | strip_newlines }}"
```
to `search.json` after the `"date"` line to which you must add a comma (`,`).


# Install with bower

```
bower install simple-jekyll-search
```





# Options

You can customize several aspects of the plugin.

The library exposes one method called `init`, to which you can pass your preferences in form of a Hashmap, like this:

```
SimpleJekyllSearch.init({
  searchInput: document.getElementById('search-input'),
  resultsContainer: document.getElementById('results-container'),
  dataSource: '/search.json',
})
```

### searchInput (Element) [required]

The input element on which the plugin should listen for keyboard event and trigger the searching and rendering for articles.


### resultsContainer (Element) [required]

The container element in which the search results should be rendered in. Typically and `<ul>`.


### dataSource (String|JSON) [required]

You can either pass in an URL to the `search.json` file, or the results in form of JSON directly, to save one round trip to get the data.


### searchResultTemplate

The template of a single rendered search result.

The templating syntax is very simple: You just enclose the properties you want to replace with curly braces.

E.g.

The template

```
<li><a href="{url}">{title}</a></li>
```

will render to the following

```
<li><a href="/jekyll/update/2014/11/01/welcome-to-jekyll.html">Welcome to Jekyll!</a></li>
```

If the `search.json` contains this data

```
[

    {
      "title"    : "Welcome to Jekyll!",
      "category" : "",
      "tags"     : "",
      "url"      : "/jekyll/update/2014/11/01/welcome-to-jekyll.html",
      "date"     : "2014-11-01 21:07:22 +0100"
    }

]
```


### noResultsText

The HTML that will be shown if the query didn't match anything.


### limit

You can limit the number of posts rendered on the page.



### fuzzy

Enable fuzzy search to allow less restrictive matching.






##Browser support

Browser support should be about IE6+ with this `addEventListener` [shim](https://gist.github.com/eirikbacker/2864711#file-addeventlistener-polyfill-js)





# Dev setup

- `npm install` the dependencies.

- `gulp watch` during development

- `npm test` or `npm run watch-test` to run the unit tests
